# Auction app with Flask

Auction app that I made with flask for my university project. It has 2 clients - 1 which is webapp and 1 mobile app. Currently for the mobile app to work it has to be ran on same machine or they have to be in the same network with some small code changes to the endpoints.
For the mobile version on the app check: https://github.com/ChunChun20/MobileAppForAuctionAppPart2

Simple registration page . Phone number was needed to send mails with the help of Twillio but my free trial expired so it no longer has that feature.
